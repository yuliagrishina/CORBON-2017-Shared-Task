Mao ’ s China at 60
LONDON – Every country is shaped by its history , but countries fabricate and rewrite their histories , too .
The story of how we became who we are needs to accommodate our sense of tribal solidarity and accomplishment .
Our triumphs and virtues are exaggerated ; our villains externalized ; our failings covered up .
All this makes the study of history potentially insurrectionary , but hugely valuable .
Good historians encourage us to be honest about ourselves .
They destroy our self-delusions .
This is especially true of our flawed heroes , as we see today with the Chinese Communist Party ’ s treatment of Mao Zedong .
Sixty years ago this October , Mao stood on the rostrum of Tiananmen , the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing , and declared the founding of the People ’ s Republic .
That moment marked the end of years of war and terrible hardship ; the revolution had been won through blood , sacrifice , heroism , the mistakes of enemies , and the manipulative assistance of Stalin , who purported to be a friend .
The decades of rapacious war lords , greedy imperialists , and Japanese invaders were over ;
China could stand up – though much misery still lay ahead as Mao ’ s tyranny put down its roots .
Verdicts on Mao differ wildly .
For hard-line Communists , he was a hero three times over – historical , patriotic , and world-class .
For the brave and charismatic dissident Wei Jingsheng , Mao “ cast virtually the whole of China into a state of violence , duplicity , and poverty . ”
The Communist Party ’ s official verdict , undoubtedly the product of fierce ideological disputes , is that he was a great Marxist and revolutionary , whose “ gross mistakes ” during the Cultural Revolution were outweighed by his contribution to China .
“ His merits , ” it argues , “ are primary and his errors secondary . ”
China ’ s Communist Party will not tolerate any questioning of this assessment .
Mao ’ s establishment of authority over China , his injection of patriotic pride into a land that had been appallingly sundered and humiliated by external and internal forces for a century and a half , and his romantic legend as a global revolutionary leader – all contribute to the moral and political legitimacy for which China ’ s leaders search .
What they cannot gain through democratic elections they acquire through the history of the revolution and today ’ s economic triumphs .
But the dark side of Mao cannot be totally expunged .
Too many people remember what happened .
It is an intimate part of their family stories .
There was the Great Leap Forward , which led to mass starvation and perhaps as many as 38 million deaths .
Then the madness of the Cultural Revolution , when millions suffered terribly , many died , and many more behaved disgracefully as Mao sought to destroy those who had rescued China from his earlier follies .
Jung Chang ’ s famous biography of Mao , published in 2005 , recounts those awful events in the sort of bleak detail that makes Communist propagandists nervous – and some academic Sinologists critical that Mao ’ s achievements go too little recognized .
Mao is certainly a more interesting figure than were many tyrants – a poet , an intellectual , a student of history as well as a serial philanderer , who , according to his doctor , Li Zhisui , liked to swim in water , not bathe in it .
I know of no better , more fascinating “ warts and all ” portrait of any political leader than Li ’ s book , The Private Life of Chairman Mao .
I remember being told a story about China that gives credence to the Communist leadership ’ s generous verdict on Mao .
The mother of a Chinese journalist ( now living outside the country ) had been one of those who returned after 1949 to her homeland with her husband and family from a comfortable life at an American university .
They regarded returning as their patriotic duty .
The family sacrificed everything .
They were hit by round after round of Mao ’ s tyrannical campaigns against “ Rightists , ” beginning with the silencing of critics after the Hundred Flowers Movement in 1956 .
The family lived in penury .
The father died from ill-treatment during the Cultural Revolution .
But the mother never complained .
She believed that her family ’ s sacrifices were justified by the liberation and rise of China .
Towards the end of her life , this mood changed .
She saw in the 1990 ’ s the beginning of China ’ s economic ascent – the early years of spectacular growth .
She witnessed the return of the greed and corruption that she believed had destroyed the Kuomintang in the 1930 ’ s and 1940 ’ s .
Why , she asked herself , had her family suffered so much if it was only to prepare the way for this ?
Yet it is China ’ s economic renaissance – some of whose effects so disturbed this patriotic old woman – which has been the most remarkable event in recent world history .
The economic turnaround began under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping , who had survived Mao ’ s purges to follow in his footsteps and become the architect of China ’ s rise as a world power .
The hundreds of millions of Chinese who have been lifted out of poverty as a result of Deng ’ s reforms will in time regard him as a greater hero than Mao .
But , whatever Mao ’ s terrible failings , during his years of absolute power there was a sense of common purpose and solidarity that went with shared hardship .
Maoism was a curious and unique mixture of class warfare and socialist leveling , all enunciated by a man who believed that individuals – or at least Mao himself – could shape history rather than be formed by its tides and currents .
This creed has clearly not survived its creator .
Pragmatism with a Leninist face is the order of the day .
The glories of getting rich have overwhelmed the deprivations of patriotic self-sacrifice .
Mao made China proud . Deng made it prosperous .
What happens next ?
For all our sakes , I hope that the future does not derail China ’ s economic progress , though it will be a surprise if it does not challenge its arthritic and adamantine political system .
