Krugman ’ s Anti-Cameron Contradiction
NEW YORK – It is truly odd to read Paul Krugman rail , time and again , against the British government .
His latest screed begins with the claim that “ Britain ’ s economic performance since the financial crisis struck has been startlingly bad . ” He excoriates Prime Minister David Cameron ’ s government for its “ poor economic record , ” and wonders how he and his cabinet can possibly pose “ as the guardians of prosperity . ”
Hmm .
In recent months , Krugman has repeatedly praised the US economic recovery under President Barack Obama , while attacking the United Kingdom ’ s record .
But when we compare the two economies side by side , their trajectories are broadly similar , with the UK outperforming the United States on certain indicators .
Consider , first , the unemployment rate .
In the fourth quarter of 2007 , the UK ’ s rate was 5.2 % .
When Cameron ’ s government took office in May 2010 , it was 7.9 % .
In the most recent reporting period ( November 2014-January 2015 ) , it was 5.7 % .
In the US , the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 4.8 % , 9.8 % in March-May 2010 , and 5.7 % in November 2014-January 2015 .
In both countries , the unemployment rate is therefore slightly above the pre-crisis ( end-2007 ) level , with no significant net difference over the business cycle from the end of 2007 until now .
Next , let ’ s look at the employment rate , which in the UK stood at 72.9 % of the population aged 16-64 at the end of 2007 .
It fell to 70.4 % by the time the Cameron government came to power , but since then has risen strongly , to 73.3 % in November 2014-January 2015 , an all-time high .
In the US , by contrast , the employment rate was 62.8 % at the end of 2007 , 58.6 % in March-May 2010 , and then only slightly higher , at 59.2 % , during November 2014-January 2015 – still below the pre-crisis level .
This suggests that there are more discouraged workers in the US than in the UK .
Finally , there is output growth .
In the UK , real ( inflation-adjusted ) GDP fell by 3.8 % from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2010 .
It then rose by 8.1 % from that point until the fourth quarter of 2014 .
In the US , real GDP fell by 1.6 % from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2010 , and then rose by 10.5 % from then until the fourth quarter of 2014 .
Thus , both countries have experienced moderately high and broadly similar growth rates since May 2010 , when Cameron ’ s government took power .
Yes , UK growth has been slightly slower , but the British economy has also faced , among other factors , the headwind of sharply falling North Sea oil production during this period , whereas the US benefited from a shale-oil boom .
Obviously , neither of these long-term trends can be fairly attributed to the governments currently in office .
In any case , during the past two years , from the fourth quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2014 , the US economy grew by a cumulative 5.6 % while the UK economy grew by 5.4 % , essentially the same as the US .
Krugman seems to make much of the fact that the UK did not bounce back even more strongly from a larger output decline between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2010 – a fall that occurred before the Cameron government took office .
That is true , and measured UK productivity growth has remained low , but nobody can be sure why .
Perhaps the unsustainable pre-2008 bubble was larger in the UK ; perhaps the UK ’ s structure ( particularly the larger share of finance in its GDP and the continued decline in energy output ) made the initial downturn less reversible .
The UK has been more vulnerable than the US to the eurozone ’ s prolonged crisis .
Moreover , subtle differences between the US and UK in national income accounting should be taken into account in comparing productivity trends .
The International Monetary Fund ’ s estimate of the output gap ( see its World Economic Outlook database ) for both countries does not suggest that , as of 2014 , the UK is more cyclically depressed than the US .
Indeed , in the IMF ’ s estimates at least , the opposite is the case .
The IMF puts the UK output gap ( as a percent of potential GDP ) at 1.2 % , compared to 3.5 % in the US .
Of course , both estimates are subject to questions of interpretation ; the IMF assumes , for example , that the UK was operating well above potential GDP in 2006-8 .
The fact is that the US and UK economies look rather alike in their overall cyclical patterns , with sharp downturns from 2007 to 2010 followed by recoveries in both jobs and GDP since then , and with a fairly rapid pace of recovery in the past two years .
So , if Krugman praises the Obama recovery , he should also praise the Cameron recovery .
They are very similar .
Perhaps more notable is that both the US and UK economies have cast considerable doubt on Krugman ’ s oft-repeated view that a robust recovery would require further fiscal stimulus , a position that he maintained at least until 2013 .
The post-2010 recoveries in both countries came despite significant cuts in the structural ( cyclically adjusted ) budget deficit , suggesting that both recoveries occurred in the face of fiscal contraction .
According to the IMF estimates , the structural budget deficit was cut from 8.4 % of potential GDP in 2010 to 4.1 % in 2014 in the UK , and from 9.1 % to 4 % in the US during the same period .
Rather than lambasting Cameron while lauding Obama , Krugman should be praising both countries for their recoveries .
The truth is that – barring another Greek tragedy – both the UK and US are finally out of the post-2008 crisis .
It is time for both countries to move beyond short-term macroeconomic policy and turn their attention to the challenges of long-term sustainable development .
