The EU ’ s Kyoto Shell Game
RIGA – With each passing year , the impending crisis of global warming looms closer and closer .
Time is running out for preventative action to be taken .
The European Union ’ s “ 20-20-20 ” mantra aims to cut greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions by 20 % relative to their level in 1990 and to increase the share of renewable resources to 20 % by the year 2020 .
Is it really viable ?
The EU seemingly has a long-term record of championing action to prevent climate change .
In 1994 , the EU committed itself to the GHG reductions set forth by the Kyoto Protocol and ratified it in 2002 .
The EU-15 promised an 8 % reduction in GHG emissions by 2010 .
Every the industrial nation that has not ratified the Kyoto protocol , first and foremost the United States , has been criticized for being “ environmentally irresponsible . ”
But in the 15-year period between 1990 and 2005 , the EU-15 managed to reduce GHG emissions by only 2 % , and it is now obvious that the EU-15 will not fulfill its Kyoto commitment . Only five of the EU-15 countries are on track to meet their targets .
The EU-15 could , under the best of circumstances , reduce its emissions by 4.6 % by 2010 .
The failure of the EU-15 to meet its Kyoto target does not come as a big surprise .
However , what is surprising is that the EU-15 have managed to market their failure as a success .
When the 20-20-20 commitment was adopted in March 2007 , the decision was much trumpeted and sold to the public as another success for EU climate change policy .
Then EU Council President Angela Merkel called it “ a breakthrough , ” and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso proclaimed it “ the most ambitious package ever . ”
However , when it came to sharing the burden of emissions reduction among EU member states , the European Commission proposed in January 2008 to change the base year from 1990 to 2005 .
This approach – endorsed as a basis for negotiation in the recent EU Council – amounted to allowing some member states not to fulfill their supposedly binding Kyoto burden-sharing targets .
The reason was simple : The EU-12 – the new members admitted in 2004 – have been outperforming the EU-15 .
The new members have not agreed to a collective Kyoto goal , but as a group they are projected to reduce emissions relative to 1990 by around 20 % by 2010 .
Latvia , Lithuania , and Estonia have , for example , managed to more than halve their 1990 emissions by 2005 . This can partly be attributed to the collapse of heavily polluting Soviet-style industry .
But , in changing the base year for absolute emission levels from 1990 to 2005 , the Commission also seems to be trying to cover up the EU-15 ’ s failure while pushing excessively large reduction targets onto the EU member states that are already the most environmentally efficient .
By sacrificing the needs of growing economies that have met their goals to those of more established markets , the Commission is rewarding inefficiency and reducing the effectiveness of the European Union ’ s climate change policy and its common market .
With the EU-15 comprising around 80 % of all EU GHG emissions , these countries should be the ones taking a leading role in EU climate change policy . It is past time that they step up their efforts .
