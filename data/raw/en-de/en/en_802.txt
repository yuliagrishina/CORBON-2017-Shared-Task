Can the Stability Pact Be Reformed ?
The European Commission recently proposed important changes to how the Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) is to be implemented .
Now the Commission and ECOFIN ( the committee of euro area finance ministers ) are reviewing the proposals , as well as others put forward by member states .
A decision is expected in the first half of 2005 , but how the Pact will be revised remains uncertain .
The need for reform is self-evident : with structural factors accounting for 75-80 % of aggregate budget deficits for the euro area in recent years , the Pact ’ s 3 % -of-GDP ceiling for national budget deficits has been breached repeatedly since 2002 .
Smaller member states , notably Finland and Ireland ( as well as Spain ) and the two non-euro area countries Denmark and Sweden , have stuck to the principle of fiscal balance or small – though diminishing – surpluses .
But the largest European Union members , including the United Kingdom , France , and Germany , have been unable or unwilling to play by the rules .
Indeed , France and Germany barely escaped financial sanctions in November 2003 for their violations of the Pact .
Although the European Court of Justice later declared that decision invalid , the impasse remains .
So either fiscal behavior or the Pact ’ s rules must change .
The European Commission ’ s recent proposals amount to a relaxation of its earlier hard-line stance , providing a catalogue of ways in which the fiscal rules can be made more flexible .
But it is difficult to see how this hodge-podge will “ strengthen economic governance ” or clarify the Pact ’ s implementation .
None of the proposals are mutually exclusive , but there are trade-offs .
If , for example , one extends the time period over which member states are required to conform to the rules , there is less need to modify the rules themselves .
If deficits are redefined to exclude certain expenditures , the 3 % ceiling can be observed .
But removing some public expenditures from the deficit runs counter to sound execution of fiscal policy .
For example , Germany recently proposed that expenditures undertaken to meet European commitments – such as Rampamp ; D spending to support the Lisbon agenda of enhanced productivity – be exempted .
The problem is that allowing public investment to be financed by borrowing would lead to continuing disputes between the Commission and individual member states , because it relies excessively on that blurred distinction .
Others seek to broaden the definition of “ exceptional circumstances ” to permit the deficit ceiling to be breached in any year with prolonged unsatisfactory GDP growth , not just -2 % .
In particular , countries that break the Pact ’ s deficit ceiling because they overestimated their growth – and hence government revenue – want to be treated more leniently than those who deliberately violate the rules .
This may sound principled , but basing deficit monitoring on targets rather than outcomes merely strengthens an already powerful incentive for governments to rig their forecasts .
Yet an exception might be warranted where a violation of the deficit ceiling has led to fiscal tightening in line with advice from the Commission and endorsed by Ecofin .
Having violated the ceiling in 2002 , Germany looked set to do so again in 2003 despite tightening its budget along Commission lines .
When it turned out that Germany ’ s starting position had been more unfavorable than initially thought and that revenues were again failing , Germany ’ s government objected to additional consolidation .
Where a country ’ s fiscal adjustments have been approved by its peers , there should be limits on how much more can be asked of it .
All of this may be beside the point , for it is the threat of financial sanctions under the Pact that inspired governments to seek to reform its rules .
But the Commission now proposes to put the emphasis entirely on peer pressure – naming and shaming offenders .
This may encourage national policy-makers who defend the SGP ’ s deficit ceiling to continue to do so , but peer pressure will lose some of its effectiveness when the ultimate threat of sanctions disappears .
In short , the Commission ’ s proposals and the follow-up suggestions put forward by some governments have forced open a Pandora ’ s Box .
Both the Commission and the euro area countries seem to be hoping that more rapid growth will ease – and ideally resolve – the dilemma that reform of the Pact has put before them .
