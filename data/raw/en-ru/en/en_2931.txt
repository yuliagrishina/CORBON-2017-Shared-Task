Rediscovering the West
Transatlantic disputes are multiplying at the very moment that Europe 's Constitutional Convention begins to debate a joint EU foreign policy .
Ralf Dahrendorf thinks that both sides of the Atlantic need to look beyond the trivial and rediscover the common interests and values of the West .
Hardly a week goes by without some addition to the already long list of European-American gripes and irritants .
One week it is the UN Security Council vote about a continued US presence in the Bosnia peacekeeping mission .
Before that the setting up of the International Criminal Court without American participation set both sides on edge , and the question of whether the Palestinians should be told whom not to elect as their leader .
Israel and the Palestinians remain a subject of profound Europe-US disagreements , as are issues surrounding the environment and the idea of sustainable development .
Add to these US trade sanctions , America 's latest Farm Bill , and of course the whole question of alleged or real US unilateralism .
Fortunately , such spats are not the whole truth .
American unilateralism is in fact a form of " multilateralism Ã  la carte " .
Where it suits American interests , international institutions are happily used , and they usually serve European interests .
Also one must never forget that we are talking about democracies .
In the US , as in Europe , there are many different views about Bosnia , about Arafat , even about protecting farmers .
After all , not every American voted for President Bush , nor is every European a Eurofederalist .
Still , when representatives of the US and the EU meet for formal consultations , they arrive at the table with different perceptions .
US participants represent a country at war in which energies are concentrated on defeating the enemy , " terrorism , " whether of the Al Queda or Iraqi variety .
EU participants on the other hand represent ... well , what exactly ?
If the issue is trade , then the answer is clear .
In so far as the European Union is a " single market , " it is represented by the Trade Commissioner , Pascal Lamy .
If the issue is competition , Commissioner Mario Monti represents Europe , stridently so , as Americans have learned to their surprise .
But as soon as we move to wider issues of foreign and defense policy , Xavier Solana , the High Representative of the EU Council of Ministers , may be at the telephone number that Henry Kissinger famously could never find in Brussels when he wanted to " speak to Europe " in his day , but Solana is hardly in a position to speak for " Europe " in important matters today .
European attitudes demonstrate the consequences .
Americans are right to point out that Europeans spend an undue amount of time consulting among themselves , and then come up with very little .
Most of the time , they agree only to try to put the brakes on firm action .
They are reluctant .
" Don 't go too fast in welcoming Russia to NATO ! "
" Don 't go too far in supporting Israel and neglecting the Palestinians ! "
" Don 't extend the fight against terrorism to the producers of weapons of mass destruction ! "
What should be done instead ?
" Political solutions " should be found , which really means that the European method of consensus building without firm action should be applied to the world at large .
Sometimes the two methods - consultation without action in Europe , actions without consultation in the US - can be turned to mutual advantage .
If Europeans do not want to go to war , and Americans do not want to get involved in protracted processes of institution building in distant places , an obvious potential for an international division of labor emerges .
To some extent it is practiced already both in Afghanistan and in the Balkans .
At other times , a dangerous potential for division arises between Europeans and the US .
Quite a few in Europe define the EU as an instrument for holding their own against the United States .
They see even the Euro as a weapon against the dollar and rejoice when the Euro is " strong " and the dollar is " weak " .
The US has found a new " empire of evil " in " terrorist " states and organizations ; Europe has found a new adversary who helps it integrate in the United States .
This is a dangerous state of affairs for those on either side of the Atlantic who believe in the values of the enlightenment and in the constitution of liberty .
In terms of basic values , there is such a thing as the West .
After September 11 th , it has become more important than ever .
Defending the values of the West against anti-enlightenment forces both within and without may well be the most important task ahead for all who believe in liberty .
It is unfortunate that some in America , and many in Europe , seem to have forgotten , at least temporarily , that this is what our efforts are all about .
Europeans do not want to fight , not even for their basic values , and Americans think they are fighting only as patriots of their great country .
Neither vision is good enough .
Rediscovering the West and the institutions that go with it , and defending them with whatever it takes , is the primary issue on the agenda of liberty today .
