Unfreezing Europe \ u0027s Northern Dimension
COPENHAGEN : Slowly , ever so slowly , Europe is establishing its new political geography .
Enlargement of the European Union to include the first batch of applicant countries is now within reach as more and more chapters are closed in the bilateral negotiations .
The biggest remaining hurdle concerns the political will among today 's EU members to set the actual dates for enlargement .
Later this year , in Prague , NATO 's leaders may also give the green light to the next group of new members .
So 2001 can be a crucial year in the never-ending story of the creation of a new and better Europe .
This is why relations with Russia must also be placed high on Europe 's agenda this year .
If you look at the new map of Europe , it is obvious where the focus must be : Northwest Russia already shares borders with both the EU and NATO ( a fact often missed by those who argue against " expanding NATO right up to the borders of Russia " ) .
This proximity offers the prospect of friction or , if Europe seizes the moment , the most promising of possibilities for economic growth .
After all , Russia 's reforms , many of Russia 's leading reformers , and President Putin himself all began their careers in St. Petersburg .
The " Northern Dimension , " a concept developed during Finland 's EU-presidency of two years ago , has been picked up by the present Swedish presidency .
On April 9th , foreign ministers from the EU , Russia , and other countries from the Baltic Sea Region will meet in Luxembourg to review implementation of the so-called Northern Dimension Action Plan and provide political guidance for developing this initiative .
An injection of renewed purpose from the EU 's political leaders is undoubtedly needed .
Such could provide inspiration for the entire region , including its postcommunist countries , where a huge potential for growth exists .
The driving force , however , can only be an understanding that EU enlargement must be regarded as a win-win situation for all countries involved directly or indirectly - including Russia .
For Russia has legitimate and undeniable interests at stake .
Think of the Kaliningrad-oblast . With Lithuania 's independence it was cut off by land from Russia .
Soon , it may appear even more isolated to Russians , as Poland and Lithuania enforce the EU 's Schengen border rules .
To secure regional stability , Russia must be convinced that all countries have the right to choose the international organisations in which they wish to be members .
So Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania cannot be regarded as special Russian " spheres of influence " requiring Russian assent for membership in either the EU or NATO .
Yet , to obtain that kind of understanding , Russia must be able to see its own interests - in particular the economic health of Kaliningrad and Northwest Russia - taken into account as the EU enlarges .
So co-operation between Russia and the EU must be extended on many practical issues .
Unleashing the potential for growth in the Baltic Sea Region is one powerful way to achieve this end .
Governments and think-tanks in the region are already pointing the way ahead .
A recent study presented at the Baltic Development Forum suggested that , if Poland and the three Baltic countries become EU members in 2003 and continue their efforts to catch up economically with the rest of the Union , annual growth in their GDP can be 2-4 % higher than the EU-average .
In the coming decade , Poland might double its GDP , the Baltic countries increase their GDP by 60 % .
The benefits of such growth for present regional EU members will more than outweigh the direct budget costs linked to enlargement .
So : a win-win situation .
But EU-enlargement alone will not do the trick .
A comprehensive strategy is needed to realise the region 's full potential .
Here Professor Michael Porter of Harvard University has proposed a " Baltic Rim Regional Agenda " to develop an innovative and co-operative mindset to improve the region 's business development .
In it , private business takes the driver 's seat in the economic and political transition .
But private business can only meet that challenge if governments are prepared to remove the many barriers that exist to growth and free trade .
In the past , the Baltic Sea Region was one of Europe 's most economically dynamic areas . Trade and cultural exchanges flourished .
Then came years of Cold War division . Half of the Baltic Sea became an economic dead sea .
When Europe 's division ended , an opportunity to recreate the Baltic 's traditional free movements of people , ideas and merchandise - all of which once contributed mightily to regional prosperity - suddenly appeared .
The importance of seizing this opportunity cannot be overstated .
Indeed , Immanuel Kant 's old imperative - that trade is peace-making - should not be forgotten .
Special resonance is added to this thought by the fact that Kant himself was born in what used to be K ‚Äù nigsberg , now Russia 's Kaliningrad .
Much talk will be heard in coming months : the ministerial meeting in Luxembourg , numerous conferences and seminars around the region , and in September a Baltic summit will be held in St. Petersburg at which political and business leaders will discuss what is needed in order to move ahead .
All this talk is essential and good . But it is vital to move quickly beyond rhetoric if we are to deal effectively with Europe 's " Northern Dimension . "
EU enlargement - and the process of involving Russia - must not be slowed by a lack of political will and vision among European leaders .
