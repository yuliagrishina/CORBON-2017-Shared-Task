Egypt ’ s Democratic Dictator ?
CAIRO – Mohamed Morsi , Egypt ’ s first-ever elected civilian president , recently granted himself sweeping temporary powers in order , he claims , to attain the objectives of the revolution that overthrew Hosni Mubarak ’ s dictatorship .
But the decrees incited strong opposition from many of the revolutionary forces that helped to overthrow Mubarak ( as well as from forces loyal to him ) , with protests erupting anew in Cairo ’ s Tahrir Square .
Morsi has thus been put in the odd position of having to defend his decision against the protesters while simultaneously making common cause with them .
“ I share your dream of a constitution for all Egyptians and with three separate powers : executive , legislative , and judicial , ” he told his opponents . “ Whoever wants Egyptians to lose this opportunity , I will stop him . ”
So , was Morsi ’ s “ auto-coup ” necessary to realize the revolution ’ s avowedly democratic goals ?
The new Constitutional Declaration , the Revolution Protection Law , and the new presidential decrees have several aims :
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; To remove the public prosecutor , a Mubarak-era holdover who failed to convict dozens of that regime ’ s officials who had been charged with corruption and / or abuse of power ;
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; To protect the remaining elected and indirectly elected institutions ( all of which have an Islamist majority ) from dissolution by Constitutional Court judges ( mostly Mubarak-era holdovers ) ;
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; To bring about retrials of Mubarak ’ s security generals ;
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; To compensate and provide pensions for the victims of repression during and after the revolution .
While most Egyptians may support Morsi ’ s aims , a dramatic expansion of presidential power in order to attain them was , for many , a step too far . & # 160 ;
Given Egypt ’ s extreme polarization and distrust between its Islamist and secular forces , Morsi should have anticipated the protests .
Suspicion of the powerful , after all , has been one of the revolution ’ s animating factors .
Another is a “ zero-sum ” attitude : any achievement by Morsi is perceived by his opponents as a loss .
The anti-Morsi forces are sharply divided ideologically and politically .
Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei , a liberal reformer , has little in common with Ahmed El-Zind , the head of the Judges Club and a Mubarak loyalist .
But the anti-Morsi forces that backed the revolution regard the price of cleansing the judiciary as too high , arguing that the constitutional declaration will lead to dictatorship .
Indeed , the declaration protects presidential decrees from judicial review ( although Morsi stipulated that it pertains only to “ sovereignty ” matters , and stressed its temporary nature ) .
It also gives the president emergency-like power to fight vague threats , such as those “ endangering the life of the nation . ”
Only if the new draft constitution is upheld in a popular referendum on December 15 will these provisions be annulled .
But the opposition factions have not been adhering to democratic principles , either .
Mostly comprising electoral losers and remnants of Mubarak ’ s regime , some aim to topple Morsi , not just get him to backtrack on his decree .
ElBaradei , for example , “ expects ” the army to do its national duty and intervene if “ things get out of hand ” – hardly a compelling democratic stance , given the army ’ s track record .
Morsi ’ s decrees have undoubtedly polarized Egyptian politics further .
The worst-case scenario is street clashes between pro- and anti-Morsi hardliners .
Historically , such clashes have often sparked civil war ( for example , Spain in 1936 or Tajikistan in 1992 ) or brutal military coups ( as in Indonesia in 1965 and Turkey in 1980 ) .
For Morsi and his supporters , it was imperative to neutralize the Constitutional Court judges , whose ruling last June dissolved the first freely elected , post-revolution People ’ s Assembly ( the parliament ’ s lower house ) .
According to the Morsi camp , the politicized Court intended to dissolve the Consultative Council ( the upper house ) and the Constitutional Assembly , as some of its judges publicly hinted .
Likewise , the sacked public prosecutor had failed to present any solid evidence against those of Mubarak ’ s security chiefs and officers who were accused of killing protestors , leading to acquittals for almost all of them .
As a president who was elected with only a 51.7 % majority , Morsi needs to be sensitive to the demands of his supporters , mainly the Islamists and revolutionaries victimized by the security forces .
But , for many revolutionaries , there were other ways to sack a tainted prosecutor and cleanse the judiciary .
For example , a new law regulating the judiciary has been a demand of the revolution since its early weeks .
For Morsi , the dilemma was that the Constitutional Court could strike down the law , rendering the effort meaningless .
He had already backed off twice : once in July 2012 , when he abandoned his effort , under pressure from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces , to reinstate the elected parliament ; and once when he tried to remove the public prosecutor by making him Egypt ’ s ambassador to the Holy See .
Morsi ’ s “ Constitutional Declaration ” was a decisive – though undemocratic , polarizing , and thus politically costly – step to break the impasse .
And , while such decrees have led to dictatorships , not democracies , in other countries undergoing political transition , none had a politicized judicial entity that played the role of spoiler in the democratization process .
Indeed , almost two years after the revolution began , Egypt ’ s security forces have not been reformed in any meaningful way .
Now , Morsi , in his effort to force out the prosecutor , will have to avoid opening another front with the Mubarak-era security generals , whom he will need to protect state institutions and maintain a minimum level of public security .
The security sector may , it seems , emerge from this crisis as the only winner .
It will enforce the rule of law , but only for a price .
That price will be reflected in the constitution , as well as in the unwritten rules of Egypt ’ s new politics .
This constitutes a much more serious and lasting threat to Egypt ’ s democratization than do Morsi ’ s temporary decrees .
