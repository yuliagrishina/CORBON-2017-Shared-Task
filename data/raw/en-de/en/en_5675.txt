Growth Out of Time
CAMBRIDGE – Robert Gordon of Northwestern University is a distinguished economist whose work in macroeconomics and studies of long-term economic growth have properly earned him high regard .
So his recent exercise in speculative future history , which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end , has attracted much favorable attention .
But a basic flaw in Gordon ’ s argument is immediately apparent – and becomes glaringly so on closer examination .
Gordon distinguishes three Industrial Revolutions that have driven economic growth and improved living standards since the eighteenth century : IR # 1 ( “ steam , railroads ” ) , whose defining inventions date from 1750 to 1830 ;
IR # 2 ( “ electricity , internal combustion engine , running water , indoor toilets , communications , entertainment , chemicals , petroleum ” ) , whose defining inventions date from 1870 to 1900 ; and IR # 3 ( “ computers , the web , mobile phones ” ) , dating from 1960 .
The core of his article contrasts the transformational impact of IR # 1 and , especially , IR # 2 on per capita GDP and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of IR # 3 .
The vulnerability of Gordon ’ s argument is his shortened time horizon for IR # 3 . Consider the following four sentences in his paper :
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; “ Both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy . ”
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; “ At a minimum , it took 150 years for IR # 1 to have its full range of effects . ”
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; “ The inventions of IR # 2 were so important … that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect . ”
· & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; & # 160 ; “ … [ T ] he productivity impact of IR # 3 evaporated after only eight years , compared to the 81 years ( 1891-1972 ) required for the benefits of IR # 2 to have their full impact … ”
The last sentence is crucial : Gordon cuts off IR # 3 circa 2005 – that is , 45 years from its onset , but less than half the time allowed for IR # 1 and IR # 2 to run their respective courses .
To take a salient example from the prior industrial revolutions , this is as if the impact of the railroads on the US economy were to be measured as of 1873 , 45 years after construction began on America ’ s first line , the Baltimore & amp ; Ohio .
In 1873 , the retailer Montgomery Ward was just a year old , and the first Sears Roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away .
Together , these companies invented mail order as the “ killer app ” of the railroad age , creating a continental market for consumer goods , with all of the economies of scale that followed .
Or , to take another example , what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electrification only 45 years after the first generating plant , Thomas Edison ’ s Pearl Street Station , became operational in 1882 ?
At that point , America ’ s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible ( re ) configuration , which enabled distribution of generated electric power , while America ’ s home-appliance industry was in its infancy .
Gordon asserts that “ the era of computers replacing human labor was largely over ” during the past decade .
Innovation in information and communications technology ( ICT ) focused first on electronic commerce , “ itself largely completed by 2005 . ” After that , “ labor-saving innovation ” took a back seat to “ a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before , but now in smaller and more convenient packages . ”
In thus truncating and trivializing the ongoing ICT revolution , Gordon misses two fundamental processes .
First , and most evident , the rise of e-commerce is far from over .
In the US , the most advanced country in this respect , e-commerce has just reached 10 % of total retail spending , and is continuing to grow at double-digit rates through the slow recovery from the Great Recession .
At the same time , something much more significant is happening beneath the economic surface .
From the early days of the computer revolution , researchers and popularizers envisioned “ artificial intelligence ” as the ultimate killer app ( literally , in the case of the computer HAL in the film 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) .
Decades of frustration are now yielding to success : the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures .
For proof of artificial intelligent “ life , ” consider the “ virtual assistants ” populating smart phones , beginning – but just beginning – with Apple ’ s Siri .
The next wave of IR # 3 ’ s consequences can be discerned in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed transaction , and in the application of predictive analytics to industrial supply chains and service provisioning .
If these innovations ’ prospective impact on productivity and GDP growth cannot be quantified , well , that is the way it is with future history .
Flawed as Gordon ’ s reading of IR # 3 is , his concluding concern for the future of innovation in the US is well founded .
Of the assorted “ headwinds ” that he cites , the enormous increase in inequality and the plateau reached in educational attainment represent threats that differentiate America ’ s position from that of other advanced countries .
But Gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued US global leadership in innovation : the delegitimation over the past generation of the state ’ s role as an economic actor .
As I illustrate and analyze at length in my new book , Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy : Markets , Speculation and the State , the state has become central to the Innovation Economy ’ s dynamics .
It funds the upstream research that generates discovery and invention ; supports the creation of new networks , from canals to the Internet ; and serves as a creative customer for innovative products , as it did during the computer revolution ’ s nascence .
The state must also preserve continuity in the market economy when the speculative bubble that has funded its transformation bursts .
And here , too , Gordon disappoints .
The only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabilizing role . Rather , it is to the asserted headwind represented by the very debt incurred to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from triggering a second Great Depression .
